A simple 2D platformer videogame in **Godot Engine 4**.

Videogame based on the tutorial provided by *Coco Code* on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_zN-7Xggw4), but **highly modified** and **improved** by me.

Character sprites by provided for free by *Pixel Frog* on [itch.io](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/).
